PROBLEM STATEMENT : Inside ODC, after every 90 days, we have to change client password,
 but there is a catch; u can create password that is exactly 8 characters long
 and it should contain atleast one uppercase, one lowercase, one number and no special characters
 and also u cannot use last 4 passwords
 
SOLUTION : create a utility to create password like that and store that in current user folder
